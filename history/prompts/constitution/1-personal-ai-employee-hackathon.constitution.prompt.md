# Personal AI Employee Hackathon Constitution

## User Input

```text
/sp.constitution make a constitution for this Personal AI Employee Hackathon 0: Building Autonomous FTEs (Full-Time Equivalent) in 2026
Tagline: Your life and business on autopilot. Local-first, agent-driven, human-in-the-loop.
This document serves as a comprehensive architectural blueprint and hackathon guide for building a "Digital FTE" (Full-Time Equivalent). It proposes a futuristic, local-first approach to automation where an AI agent—powered by Claude Code and Obsidian—proactively manages personal and business affairs 24/7. You can also think of it as a "Smart Consultant" (General Agents). The focus is on high-level reasoning, autonomy, and flexibility. Think of it as hiring a senior employee who figures out how to solve the problems.
```

### Core Principles
1. Local-First Architecture
2. Human-in-the-Loop Safety
3. Agentic Autonomy with Guardrails
4. File-Based State Management
5. Modular Component Architecture
6. Security-First Design

### Architecture Requirements
- Technology stack specifications
- Security requirements
- Performance standards

### Development Workflow
- Tiered development approach (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
- Quality gates and review process
